## HANDLE EDGE CASES
- redirects
- https
- different subdomains
- broken webpages (i.e. don't give 200 response)
- poorly formatted html
- a links to files instead of webpages
- robots.txt

## HTML PARSING - LINKS AND STATIC ASSETS
- link, a: href
- script, video, source, img, audio, iframe: src
- object, embed: data

## TODO
- request webpage
- parse html, get static content and links in a user-defined data type
- build json from this data type

## CLARITY AND TESTING
- readme and commenting
- tests

## EXTENSIONS
- check sitemap.xml first
- respect robots.txt

## FURTHER EXTENSIONS
- try also writing in python / java
